**UNDER CONSTRUCTION** - the contents of this file are written ahead of their implementation.

**Keymail is an authentication via email-system, meant to be an alternative to passwords.**


> #### This email was sent to you by [KeymailExample](http://keymail-example.herokuapp.com)
>
> To log in, simply click this link:
>
>    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<http://keymail-example.herokuapp.com/auth/A8D6mZOY2O8hDla2o8T2JQ>
>
> If you want to log in on a different device than you received this email on, use this security code instead:
>
>    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**7203931**
>
> _(This is useful for example if you want to log in to a friends computer and receive emails on your phone)_
>
> The codes above are valid until _2014-04-10 18:35_

This frees you both from the trouble of managing passwords, and the risks of delegating to a third party (like OAuth).
