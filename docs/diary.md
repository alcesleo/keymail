## Week 1/2

begun with building a simple proof of concept in a simple Rails app,
then I began building the sample app to get a better feel for what I
would want to have this gem do. 

I immediately flushed out some of the use cases I never thought of before.

After that I started working on the README for the project, doing some
simple RDD.

I also tried to get in the habit of making a milestone on Github for every
Friday to keep track of the direction I was going in.
