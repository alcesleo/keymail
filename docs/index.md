# Keymail's documentation

**Keymail** is a Rails gem that does authentication via email. It was inspired by
[this blogpost](http://notes.xoxco.com/post/27999787765/is-it-time-for-password-less-login)
and tries to be a better default than passwords and a simpler alternative to OAuth.

## [Usage](/usage)

Here lives all the installation and configuration instructions.

## [Development](/development)

For developers/contributors, here is documentation about the code and implementation.

## [Project](/project)

For anyone who's interested - here are things like my diary, notes and organization about
the project itself.

## Important note on terms

Keymail does only **authentication**, it has nothing to do with
_authorization_, if you see the abbreviation 'auth', it **always** refers to
the former.
