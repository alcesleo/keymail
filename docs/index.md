# Keymail's documentation

**Keymail** is a Rails gem that does authentication via email. It was inspired by
[this blogpost](http://notes.xoxco.com/post/27999787765/is-it-time-for-password-less-login)
and tries to be a better default than passwords and a simpler alternative to OAuth.

Keymail does only **authentication**, it has nothing to do with
_authorization_, if you see the abbreviation 'auth', it **always** refers to
the former.
