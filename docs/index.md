# Welcome to Keymail's documentation

There are two main sections of the documentation:

TODO: LINKS

- [Usage](/usage) is for users of the Gem.
- [Development](/dev) is about the project itself.

Keymail does only **authentication**, it has nothing to do with
_authorization_, hence the abbreviation 'auth' alway refers to the former.
