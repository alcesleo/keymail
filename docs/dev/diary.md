## Week 1/2

I begun with building a proof of concept in a simple Rails app,
then I began building the sample app to get a better feel for what I
would want to have this gem do.

I immediately flushed out some of the use cases I didn't think of before.

After that I started working on the README for the project (RDD-style).

I also tried to get in the habit of making a milestone on Github for every
Friday to keep track of the direction I was going in.
