# Diary

I'll write a little every week on how the project is progressing, sort
of like a sprint retrospective.

## Week 1

First I started building a simple proof of concept in a normal Rails app,
hacking together a working example was as easy as I could have hoped for.

I immediately flushed out some of the use cases I didn't think of before.

## Week 2

I made a `keymail-example` app, (a message board) to have something real to
install the gem in, at this moment completely lacking login functionality -
this will be part of the gem.

After that I started working on the README for the main project
([RDD](http://tom.preston-werner.com/2010/08/23/readme-driven-development.html)-style),
I also sketched on a couple of sequence diagrams and class diagrams.

I'm trying to use Github Issues for project management, so I've been fiddling
with labels and milestones a bit in both projects - seems to be a very pleasant
way of doing things.

I'll try to have a milestone on each Friday just to see that the project is
going in the right direction.
